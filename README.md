# Cross-Country Music Preferences with R

## Overview
- Scraped data from Kworb.net to obtain the most streamed songs per country on Spotify over the 2013-2021 period.
- Estimated the percentage of songs per country which were among the top 200 most streamed ones only nationally.

## Preliminary findings
- The data contains 12,600 songs for a total of 63 countries.
- There is considerable cross-country variability for the top 200 most streamed songs: 75% of songs are only ranked among the top 200 in one country.
- Few songs are "international hits": only 8% of songs are ranked among the top 200 in ten or more countries.
- The top 3 most idiosyncratic countries in terms of music preferences are Turkey, Japan and Brazil. The percentage of top 200 songs who only charted nationally for these countries are 89%, 86% and 84%, respectively. This means, for example, that 178 out of the 200 most streamed songs for Turkey have not reached the top 200 anywhere else.
- Spanish- and English-speaking American countries together with Australia and New Zealand are the least idiosyncratic countries in terms of music preferences.

The following figure shows the cross-country variability for the top 200 most streamed songs:
