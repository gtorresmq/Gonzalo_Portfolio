# Cross-Country Music Preferences with R (ongoing)

## Overview
- Scraped data from Kworb.net to obtain the most streamed songs per country on Spotify over the 2013-2021 period.
- Estimated the percentage of songs per country which were among the top 200 most streamed ones only nationally.

## Preliminary findings
- The data contains 12,600 songs for a total of 63 countries.
- There is considerable cross-country variability regarding the top 200 most streamed songs: 75% of songs are only ranked among the top 200 in one country.
- Moreover, few songs are "international hits": only 8% of songs are ranked among the top 200 in ten or more countries.
